Repo for local investment network product, currently called LENA: Local Economic Network Accelerator. 
I'm hoping to change the name to Lion.

Here's the original white-paper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CWfyLtK_Xe6IuP9kkiat9gJ85Rz_Z0KaHwy5GWUasg/edit#

## Heroku App
This app is managed via Heroku and can be accessed at `flatspell.herokuapp.com`.

For local development, download the repo to your machine and setup a development branch. Then from the top level directory you can boot up a local version of the app and test your changes in real-time.
```
git checkout -b yourname/yourtask
python manage.py run
```
