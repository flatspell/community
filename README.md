Right now it's just a script for extracting nonprofit data from propublica.org. Every other API charges for their data. I do get rate-limited by pro-publica so I'll need to look into a way to get more data from them or have the script sleep for 1 minute after every 60 records or so.

Merged csv of all Washington non-profits is stored locally on my machine. TODO: Move this data to heroku postgres.
